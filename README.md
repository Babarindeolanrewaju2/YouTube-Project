# YouTube-Project for FreeCodeCamp.org
### A YouTube viewer that shows whether Free Code Camp is live streaming and info on their channel

This project was inspired by a Tweet from [@freecodecamp](https://twitter.com/freeCodeCamp) where in response to my Tweet saying I wasn't a huge fan of their [Twtich.tv](https://go.twitch.tv/) front-end project. And that a [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com) one would be even better!! :astonished: :sparkles:

YouTube API Key that I created for this project is = AIzaSyCqCuFDGmpWKfl-9sE9wbZFnpCn-jh8Mlc
It **does not** feature user authorization at this point, so the user won't be able to log into _thier_ YouTube account.
